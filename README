DATAEAST Cobra Command


Someone gave me a dead Cobra command pcb in mint condition.

I took it as a challenge to fix it. Unlike numerous
repairs log found everywhere, poking a logic probe
here and here to find a faulty 'line' was not enough.

This board was exhibiting absolute normal signals everywhere.
But behavior was totally incoherent.

I started by globally draw on the board what seemed databuses.
I was puzzled by the absence of RAM connected to the CPU (6809).
So, I started lots a small postit schematics. Then decided, ok
there is nothing for this thing, nothing for BAC06, nothing
for MXC06, well that will not be the first board to reverse.

And I started a spaghetti schematics ;) Because I found right at
the end of my work the DE-301 schematic very very similar. Probably a lot of
hours could have been saved.

With that, I redrew following DATAEAST style and now we have
a full Cobra Command schematic !

Even with the schematic it was difficult to fix it. Line H9-13 E3-1
was cut. Explanation of the  eratic behavior !

But 5 ram and two rom chip were also dead.
